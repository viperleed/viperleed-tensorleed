This repository contains the TensErLEED code originally published by V. Blum and K. Heinz.
TensErLEED is used as the backend for ViPErLEED (see viperleed.org) and the ViPErLEED team took over development and maintenance of TensErLEED with version v1.6.1.
See the license page and viperleed.org for further details.

See the releases for older TensErLEED versions going back until v1.6.0.
